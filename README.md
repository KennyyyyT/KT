The following datasets contain recipes, ratings, reviews, etc. from food.com starting from 2008. Ultimately, we are trying to find if **the distributions of the number of steps for recipes before 2014 and after 2014 are the same.** Have recipes required a significantly different amount steps to complete them during these two time periods?

This dataset contains 234429 rows.

The columns are listed below with descriptions:
| 'name' | Recipe name |
| --------- | --------- |
| 'id' | Recipe ID |
| 'minutes' | Minutes to prepare recipe |
| 'n_steps' | Number of steps in recipe |
| 'steps' | Text for recipe steps, in order |
| 'rating' | Rating given |
| 'average_rating' | Average rating given |
| 'year' | Year of submission |
